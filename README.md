# Artificial Intelligence
Course Syllabus:

• Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, historic overview  
• Blind search algorithms  
• Heuristic search algorithms  
• Inference methods  
• Expert Systems  
• Propositional Logic  
• First-order Logic  
• Reasoning  
• Knowledge-based systems, expert systems  
• Autonomous agents  
• Production Trees  
• Genetic Algorithms  
• Applications  

To pass this course I needed to submit two assignments. The first one was to solve a "robot vacuum" problem using
Depth First Search and Breadth First Search algorithms and a heuristic algorithm of my choice. The second assignment was a literature review regarding a topic of choice in the field of AI.
